Bootstrap uses NPM scripts for its build system. Our package.json includes convenient methods for working with the framework, including compiling code, running tests, and more.

To use our build system and run our documentation locally, you’ll need a copy of Bootstrap’s source files and Node. Follow these steps and you should be ready to rock:

Download and install Node.js, which we use to manage our dependencies.
Navigate to the root /bootstrap directory and run 

npm install 

to install our local dependencies listed in package.json.

Install Ruby:

sudo apt-get install ruby-full

install Bundler with:

sudo gem install bundler

and finally run:

bundle install

This will install all Ruby dependencies, such as Jekyll and plugins.

If you get the error:
file:///usr/lib/ruby/2.5.0/rubygems.rb:289:in%20%60find_spec_for_exe':%20can't%20find%20gem%20bundler%20(>=%200.a)%20with%20executable%20bundle%20(Gem::GemNotFoundException):

Solution:
rm Gemfile.lock
bundle install

When completed, you’ll be able to run the various commands provided from the command line.

Using NPM scripts
Our package.json includes the following commands and tasks:

Task	        Description
npm run dist	npm run dist creates the /dist directory with compiled files. Uses Sass, Autoprefixer, and UglifyJS.
npm test	    Same as npm run dist plus it runs tests locally
npm run docs	Builds and lints CSS and JavaScript for docs. You can then run the documentation locally via npm run docs-serve.

Run npm run to see all the npm scripts.
